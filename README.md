# Ball-Game
Made for a class taught by Jason Fritts, and with some code he helped me create, mostly having to do with the "point.py" file.

A simple "game" that draws walls and balls within CS1graphics, with simple physics simulation and collision.

To run a simple version of the game with fewer walls and obstacles, open "BallGame.py" with idle and run the module. To run the full game with more walls and obstacles, open "myGame.py" in idle and run the module

It's hard to call this a game since the user as no input, but for the sake of writing this the main ball which collect's points will be referred to as the "player's ball"

When they player's ball (yellow) comes into contact with a wall it will collide and bounce semi-realistically away from the wall. 

When the player's ball comes into contact with a blue ball, the player will acrew one point and both balls will bounce away from each other.

Running into the red obstacle will cause the player to lose 1 point.

Running into the cyan obstacle will cause the player's ball to muliply it's speed by 5x, and also award 3 points.

The green obstacle will cause the player's ball to slow down to half speed, but also rewards 3 points.

Finally, the purple obstacle simply awards the player 3 points.
